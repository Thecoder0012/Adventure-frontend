         <p class="desc about-desc">
            Here at AdventureXP, we love when people are having fun.
            <br /> This is our main focus and what drives us as
            the biggest activity center in Copenhagen.
         </p>
         <p class="desc about-desc">
            We started back in 2013, and back then we only offered a 9-hole minigolf course and a small area for
            paintball.
            But we've grown with time, and in 2017, we started to offer a bigger minigolf course, our paintball area
            expanded, too,
            and we also started to offer go kart and sumowrestling.
         </p>

         <p class="desc about-desc">
            Now, we have the highest annually amount of visitors, and we hope that we in the future will have a lot more

            to offer for our customers; also something that hopefully will attract new visitors.
